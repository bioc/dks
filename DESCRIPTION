Title: The double Kolmogorov-Smirnov package for evaluating multiple testing procedures. 
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Jeffrey T. Leek <jleek@jhsph.edu> 
Description: The dks package consists of a set of diagnostic functions for multiple testing methods. The functions can be used to determine if the p-values produced by a multiple testing procedure are correct. These functions are designed to be applied to simulated data. The functions require the entire set of p-values from multiple simulated studies, so that the joint distribution can be evaluated.
